# Lyrics Tags Generator ([tags.notnick.io](https://tags.notnick.io/))

This is a small utility tool for personal use, but you can also use it if you have a music/lyric channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

## What to provide

- `Artist` *(Required)*
- `Title` *(Optional)*
- `Features` (Optional)
- `TikTok` (Optional)
- `Channel` (Optional)
- `Format` (Optional)
    - Lyrics
    - Bass Boosted
    - Nightcore/Sped Up
    - Slowed/Reverb
    - Letra
    - Phonk

If you provide both `artist` and `title` in the `artist` field, you can leave all the other fields empty.

Example:

<img width="550" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84efdc6d-c556-4299-946b-4e2838edb5d5" />

<img width="550" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66f32ff3-f84c-4a0d-ab7b-bd6bbdb2012b" />

You can also provide the `format` and it will generate the appropriate tags.

The format will _always_ default to `Lyrics` if it isn't provided.
