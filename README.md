# Lyrics Tags Generator ([tags.notnick.io](https://tags.notnick.io/))

This is a small utility tool for personal use, but you can also use it if you have a music channel on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

## What to provide

- `Artist` *(Required)*
- `Title` *(Optional)*
- `Features` (Optional)
- `TikTok` (Optional)
- `Channel` (Optional)
- `Format` (Optional)

If you think a different format works better, then please [submit an issue](https://github.com/alsonick/lyrics-tags-generator/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) or [email me](mailto:hi@notnick.io).
